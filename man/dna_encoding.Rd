\title{Encode DNA 5-mer sequences into factor-based features}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector of DNA strings (e.g., 5-mer sequences).}
}
\value{
A data frame where each column represents a nucleotide position
(nt_pos1–nt_pos5), and each value is a factor with levels A/T/C/G.
}
\description{
This function converts a vector of DNA 5-mer strings into a feature
data frame where each nucleotide position is treated as a categorical
variable. The encoded features are used as input for the m6A prediction model.
}
\examples{
dna_encoding(c("ATCGA", "TGGCA"))

}
